# Citadel Finance

**Citadel Finance** is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol and fork of [Synthereum by Jarvis Protocol](https://jarvis.network/). Designed for creating and managing synthetic assets, Citadel Finance leverages on-chain liquidity to provide users with accessible, stable, and tradable synthetic tokens on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

## Overview

Citadel Finance aims to offer a stable, secure, and transparent environment for issuing synthetic assets. Built on the Binance Smart Chain, it allows users to interact with tokenized assets that track the price of real-world assets without needing centralized exchanges. By using Citadel Finance, users gain access to global financial assets on a decentralized network.

---

## Features

- **Synthetic Assets:** Mint and trade assets that reflect the price movements of real-world assets.
- **Decentralized:** Operates directly on the blockchain, providing a transparent and tamper-proof system.
- **On-chain Liquidity:** Uses protocol-managed liquidity pools for trading synthetic assets.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive interface that enables both novice and advanced users to manage their assets.

---

## How It Works

Citadel Finance mirrors the functionality of Synthereum by leveraging the power of on-chain oracles and liquidity providers:

1. **Oracles:** Price data is collected from oracles to keep synthetic assets accurately priced.
2. **Liquidity Pools:** Liquidity providers fund these pools, earning fees and helping ensure seamless trading.
3. **Synthetic Assets:** Users can mint new synthetic assets by providing collateral, which helps maintain liquidity.

This model enables Citadel Finance to provide synthetic assets representing anything from fiat currencies to commodities and other financial instruments.

## Usage

### Running a Local Development Node

To test Citadel Finance locally, you can use a BSC-compatible local environment (e.g., Anvil from Foundry):

1. Start a local node with Anvil:

   ```bash
   anvil
   ```

2. Deploy the contracts to the local network:

   ```bash
   forge script scripts/Deploy.s.sol --fork-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast
   ```
